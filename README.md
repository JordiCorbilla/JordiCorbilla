### Hi there 👋

My name is Jordi and I'm originally from Spain (Girona) and I have been living and working in the UK for the past 10+ years. I have been coding for the past **18+ years** building end to end systems and I'm currently the Director of Application Development at [VR Capital](http://www.uk.vr-capital.com/), a global Hedge Fund focused on distressed securities and event-driven/special situations investments with a strong historical orientation towards emerging markets. I lead and mentor a number of developers across multiple regions to deliver mission-critical Front Office trading systems with an exclusive focus on end-to-end full-stack high quality software development using cutting edge technologies. I have a genuine passion for tech, a mind wired for discovery and an interest in full stack work which allows me to make an immediate impact to any business.  

I hold a **Master's degree in Computer Engineering** from the [Open University of Catalonia](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/masters-universitarios/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion), a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering** from the [Open University of Catalonia](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/grados/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion), and a **Bachelor's degree in Industrial Electronics Engineering** from the [University of Girona](https://www.udg.edu/en/estudia/Oferta-formativa/Graus/Fitxes?IDE=1048&ID=3105G0309).
