### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With over two decades of experience designing and building end-to-end systems, I have developed a deep technical skill set and a passion for delivering impactful solutions. Originally from Spain and now based in the UK, I currently serve as a Senior Software Engineer in the Trading Execution & Compliance Technology team at [Balyasny Asset Management](https://www.bamfunds.com/), a top-tier global multi-strategy hedge fund.

In my role, I architect and implement mission-critical trading and compliance platforms, leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as .NET, Python, and React. My work spans from backend engineering to user interfaces, ensuring robust, scalable, and secure systems that support complex, high-volume trading operations.

My academic background includes a Masterâ€™s in [Computer Engineering](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/masters-universitarios/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion) and a Bachelorâ€™s in [Computer Engineering](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/grados/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion) from the Open University of Catalonia, as well as a Bachelorâ€™s in Industrial [Electronics Engineering](https://www.udg.edu/en/estudia/Oferta-formativa/Graus/Fitxes?IDE=1263&ID=3105G0309) from the University of Girona. I also hold specializations in [Investment Management with Python and Machine Learning](https://coursera.org/share/d6e18431afa1b92cb83c5fdc9f2f57f1) (EDHEC), [Financial Engineering and Risk Management](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/RYBNP2KXDCWB) (Columbia University), and [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/YX4P4JSVMYXF) (Stanford University). These credentials enable me to seamlessly bridge technology and finance, applying advanced analytical and quantitative techniques to drive innovation.

I am continuously exploring new technologies, currently focusing on Deep Learning models in Python. Beyond my professional work, I share my insights and experiences on my blog, ["Random Thoughts on Coding & Technology"](https://thundaxsoftware.blogspot.com/).

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordicollcorbilla/) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thunderjordi). Iâ€™m always open to collaborating, networking, and discovering new opportunities to blend technology, finance, and cutting-edge research.
