### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jordi and I'm originally from Spain (Girona) and I have been living in the UK for the past 10 years. I have been coding for the past 18+ years and I'm currently the Director of Application Development at VR Capital, a global Hedge Fund focused on distressed securities and event-driven/special situations investments with a strong historical orientation towards emerging markets. I lead a number of developers across multiple regions to deliver Front Office trading systems with an exclusive focus on end-to-end full-stack software development using cutting edge technologies.  

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the Open University of Catalonia, a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Open University of Catalonia, and a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Electronics Engineering from the University of Girona.
