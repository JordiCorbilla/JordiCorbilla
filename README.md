### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jordi and I'm originally from Spain (Girona) and I have been living and working in the UK for the past 10+ years. I have been coding for the past **18+ years** building end to end systems and I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for the Trading & Compliance Technology department at [Balyasny Asset Management](https://www.bamfunds.com/), a global institutional investment firm where we deliver consistent, uncorrelated, absolute returns in all market environments by fostering a culture of research, innovation, and collaboration. I deliver mission-critical trading and compliance systems with an exclusive focus on end-to-end full-stack high quality software development using cutting edge technologies. I have a genuine passion for tech, a mind wired for discovery and an interest in full stack work which allows me to make an immediate impact to any business.  

I hold a **Master's degree in Computer Engineering** from the [Open University of Catalonia](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/masters-universitarios/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion), a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering** from the [Open University of Catalonia](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/grados/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion), and a **Bachelor's degree in Industrial Electronics Engineering** from the [University of Girona](https://www.udg.edu/en/estudia/Oferta-formativa/Graus/Fitxes?IDE=1048&ID=3105G0309).
