### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jordi and I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 20 years of experience in building end-to-end systems. Originally from Spain, I've been living and working in the UK for more than a decade. I currently work in the Trading Execution & Compliance Technology department at [Balyasny Asset Management](https://www.bamfunds.com/), a top-tier global multi-strategy hedge fund.

In my role, I deliver mission-critical trading and compliance systems with a focus on end-to-end full-stack software development using cutting-edge technologies such as .NET, Python, and React. I'm passionate about tech and have a mind wired for discovery, which allows me to make an immediate impact on any business.

I hold a Master's degree in [Computer Engineering](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/masters-universitarios/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion) and a Bachelor's degree in [Computer Engineering](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/grados/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion) from the Open University of Catalonia, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Industrial [Electronics Engineering](https://www.udg.edu/en/estudia/Oferta-formativa/Graus/Fitxes?IDE=1263&ID=3105G0309) from the University of Girona.  I also hold a [Machine Learning Specialization from Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/YX4P4JSVMYXF). Most recently, I have completed a specialization in [Financial Engineering and Risk Management](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/RYBNP2KXDCWB) from Columbia University.

In addition to my work, I'm currently implementing Deep Learning models using Python and always exploring new ideas and technologies. You can find my thoughts on coding and technology on my blog, ["Random Thoughts on Coding & Technology"](https://thundaxsoftware.blogspot.com/).

If you want to get in touch with me, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thunderjordi), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordicollcorbilla/). I'm always interested in connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities.
